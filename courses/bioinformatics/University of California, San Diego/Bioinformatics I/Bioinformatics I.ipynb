    "The `-ine` suffix of these nucleotides comes from the fact that they are *Nitrogen-containing* compounds (i.e. *amines*).\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA is a *quaternary* (base-4) system, although it appears it can be interpreted as binary. DNA is meant (I believe) to be read 3 lines / nucleotide-pairs at a time. This is the next layer of abstraction. Think of it as \"the assembly language\" of biology. Each of triple-pairs is called a *codon*, which are used to transcribe one of $20$ possible *amino acids* each. Since $x^y$ (`x=BasePair(BP), y=BP/Codon`) is $4^3$, or $64$, many amino acids are transcribable in more than one way.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAA, TGA, and TAG codons."
